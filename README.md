# Numeros-primos-JS

Instructions:

"Fill a 30-position array with randomly generated numbers. Then, go through the array and sum all the prime numbers in that array. Note: A prime number is one that can be divided by just two factors: the number one and itself."

I was studying array methods (filter, map, reduce) and I found this project interesting. So I made my solution, I used 'filter' to filter the prime numbers and 'reduce' to add them all.

I also tried to make the code as optimized as possible, using arrow functions and checking if the number is prime only with the square root, because if a number is not divisible by any number up to its root, it will not be divisible by another number after it, without being himself.
